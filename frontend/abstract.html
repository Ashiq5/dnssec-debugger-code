    <p>Low adoption and high misconfiguration rates continue to blunt
the security benefits of DNSSEC. Drawing on 1.1M historical diagnostic snapshots covering 319K second-level and their subdomains
between 2020 and 2024 from the DNSViz service, this paper delivers
the first longitudinal, data-driven taxonomy of real-world DNSSEC
failures. The study shows that NSEC3 misconfigurations, delegation
failures and missing/expired signatures account for more than 70%
of all bogus states, and that 18% of such domains remain broken.
Guided by these insights, we introduce DFixer: an offline tool
that (i) groups cascaded error codes into root causes, and (ii) autogenerates high-level instructions and corresponding concrete BIND
command sequences to repair them. Evaluation with a purposebuilt ZReplicator testbed demonstrates that DFixer remedies 99.99%
of observed errors in seconds. The curated error-to-command mapping is openly released to foster wider, more reliable DNSSEC
deployment.</p>
